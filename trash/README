TRASH SCRIPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION

This script is meant to replace, or supplement, the rm(8) command.  It creates 
a ~/.trash directory, and will create subdirectories from timestamps to prevent 
overwriting files, and directories with identical names.  This can be useful, 
or annoying, but it's simple, and good enough for now.


INSTALLATION

You can either create an alias to the script in your ~/bin directory, put the 
script in /usr/local/sbin, or add ~/bin to your PATH environment variable.


USAGE

trash file1 [ file 2 [ ... ] ]


MODIFICATIONS

The file 'test-trash' is the same as 'trash', except that it operates in its 
current directory.  Working on that file, and pushing the changes over to the 
other file, or copying the working copy, and adding tildes where appropriate 
are simple ways to work on the script.


LICENSE

This software is not of the public domain, and more or less "share ware", 
meaning if I haven't shared it with you, you probably shouldn't have it, and 
if I have shared it with you, you can't re-share it, you can modify it with 
attribution, and you need to pay if you use all, or parts of this code for 
commercial purposes, or in a commercial setting, sucn as on machines used 
forr work, rented servers, and the like.  You should really be able to code 
your own, and I'm not rich, so send a few bucks my way if you can.  Thanks.
